# Image-Slider
A clean, polished gallery build realised in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The page hosts a manual-navigation image slider — you can flip through 80 images using arrow keys (←/→) or press ESC to exit. A page counter (e.g., “1 / 80”) shows your place in the sequence. Minimal aesthetic, keyboard-friendly, and crafted for smooth manual control.
